    <h1>VS CODE</h1>
    <p>Visual Studio Code, commonly referred to as VS Code,[9] is an integrated development environment developed by Microsoft for Windows, Linux, macOS and web browsers.[10][11] Features include support for debugging, syntax highlighting, intelligent code completion, snippets, code refactoring, and embedded version control with Git. Users can change the theme, keyboard shortcuts, preferences, and install extensions that add functionality.

        Visual Studio Code is proprietary software released under the "Microsoft Software License",[6] but based on the MIT licensed program named "Visual Studio Code — Open Source" (also known as "Code — OSS"), also created by Microsoft and available through GitHub.[12] Open-source binaries are available from VSCodium, without Microsoft's telemetry.
        
        In the Stack Overflow 2023 Developer Survey, Visual Studio Code was ranked the most popular developer environment tool among 86,544 respondents, with 73.71% reporting that they use it.[13]</p>
    <h1>HISTORY</h1>
    <P>Visual Studio Code was first announced on April 29, 2015 by Microsoft at the 2015 Build conference. A preview build was released shortly thereafter.[14]

        On November 18, 2015, the project "Visual Studio Code — Open Source" (also known as "Code — OSS"), on which Visual Studio Code is based, was released under the open-source MIT License and made available on GitHub.[12]
        
        Extension support was also announced.[15] On April 14, 2016, Visual Studio Code graduated from the public preview stage and was released to the web.[16]
